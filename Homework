what is the difference between {TitleComponent} , {<TitleCompoent />} and {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}
As we know we can write any javascript code inside  {} (curly braces) so  the {TitleComponent} is a react element which
is at the end of the day a javascript object  and {<TitleCoponent />}  is same as <TitleComponent /> ans it is a functional 
component or a function in javascript and {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} is same as <TitleCoponent></TitleCoponent> and
it is called as JSX

What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?
All the child elements must be inisde one parent element and we can do that easilt by Putting them inside a <div></div> but that
will create an extra <div></div> tag in our code and we dont want extra tag so we use <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>.
 <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> both are same thing.

 Why we need keys in React ? When do we need keys in React ?
 A. Key is used to uniquely identify our react elements so that the reconciliation can easily find the new added element 
 and only re-render that elements intead of re-rendering all the similar elements. We need Key in react when we have multiple 
 elements of same html tag.

 <div>
    <h1></h1>
    <h1></h1>
    <h1></h1>
    <h1></h1>
 </div>

 if there is a change in h1 at third position then react will know that there is a change but it does know  which <h1></h1> 
 it need to change . So if we give keys to all the elements it will it will know which element needs to be changed and it rerender only
 that element

 Can we use index as keys in react ?
 Index is not an invalid key but we should not use it. We should always use something which is unique.
 If we do not have anything unique we should use index.

 No key <<<<<<<<<<<  index  key  << unique key 

 What is props in react ?

 What is a config driven user interface ?
 A config driven user iterface is driven by the config and the config is driven by the API or the data from backend.
 Suppose there is an element carousel which is a card element that shows offer at differen locations and suppose at a particular 
 location there is no offer and we dont want to show the carousel so in that case our User Interface is drivenby the API or data 
 from backend (the carousel array that comes from backend has no element in it so the carousel element is not shown)
